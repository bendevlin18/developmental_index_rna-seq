# developmental_index_rna-seq
Repo containing code for microglial developmental index analysis of publicly available sequencing datasets


Code is a mix of python notebooks and R scripts for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the MDI for various datasets of disease models. All developmental index calculations are done in Python using the [developmental-index package](https://pypi.org/project/developmental-index/). In all cases, the original data accession and publication links are provided at the top of the Jupyter notebook.
